# Challenge

Please prepare an auto-complete component in React TypeScript.

1.⁠ ⁠You cannot use any 3rd party libraries - only pure React and internal DOM functions.

2.⁠ ⁠You should use typescript and write proper interfaces and types.

3.⁠ ⁠The function to filter the data should be asynchronous. You can use mock data (such as a JSON array), but the function which uses it should be asynchronous (similar to a real REST call).

5.⁠ ⁠You need to handle all non-standard/edge use-cases - it should have a perfect user-experience.

6.⁠ ⁠Highlight the matching part of the text, in addition to showing it.

7.⁠ ⁠No external state management libraries (refer to #1 as well), only native React method.

8.⁠ ⁠Use only functional component with hooks.

9.⁠ ⁠⁠Input and dropdown should be extensible/editable/customizable
